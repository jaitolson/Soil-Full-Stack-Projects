Admin Dashboard Metrics Explanation
For the Admin Dashboard of the SOIL website, we have implemented two meaningful metrics to provide valuable insights into user engagement and product feedback. These metrics are:

Average Rating: This metric calculates the average star rating given by users for each product.
Reviews per Product: This metric tracks the total number of reviews submitted for each product.
1. Average Rating

The average rating metric provides an aggregate measure of user satisfaction for each product. It is calculated by taking the sum of all star ratings for a product and dividing it by the number of reviews. This metric is crucial for several reasons:

Product Quality Assessment: It helps administrators quickly identify which products are performing well and which are not meeting user expectations.
Trend Analysis: Over time, this metric can indicate if the quality of a product is improving or declining based on user feedback.
Decision Making: Products with consistently low ratings can be flagged for review, leading to improvements or removal from the catalog.
The average rating is displayed as a star rating (out of 5) on the admin dashboard, allowing for a quick visual assessment.

2. Reviews per Product

This metric tracks the total number of reviews each product has received. It provides insights into user engagement and the popularity of products. Key benefits of this metric include:

Popularity Indicator: A higher number of reviews generally indicates a product is popular among users and is likely being purchased and used frequently.
Engagement Tracking: By monitoring review counts, administrators can gauge how engaged users are with each product.
Feedback Collection: Products with a large number of reviews provide a richer set of feedback for potential improvements and enhancements.
The reviews per product metric is presented as a bar chart on the admin dashboard, making it easy to compare the popularity of different products at a glance.

In addition to the metrics, the admin dashboard includes functionality to handle inappropriate reviews. This involves:

Identifying Inappropriate Reviews: Reviews may be considered inappropriate based on various criteria, including but not limited to:

Offensive Language: Use of profanity, hate speech, or discriminatory language.
Spam: Irrelevant or promotional content not related to the product.
Malicious Content: Harmful links or content that could compromise user safety.
Deletion of Inappropriate Reviews: Admins have the ability to delete reviews deemed inappropriate. When a review is deleted, it is replaced with a message on the product reviews page indicating that the review has been removed:
Scenario 1: Offensive Language: A user posts a review containing hate speech against a specific group. Such content is flagged and deleted to maintain a respectful community.
Scenario 2: Spam Review: A review is identified as spam, promoting unrelated products or services. This review is removed to keep the reviews relevant and useful for other users.
Scenario 3: Malicious Links: A review contains links to potentially harmful websites. For the safety of all users, such reviews are promptly deleted.
